# CMPUT500Project

This project includes a tool that assists in conducting experiments of different analyses targeting search space generated. It further includes a set of analyses for this purpose.

# Files:
-*Kernels:* GEMM.py, VectorAdd.py,ConvNCHW.py,relu.py,reorg.py,resize.py,softmax.py,upsample.py
-*Passes.py* Contains the 3 analyses, naive, moderate and conservative
-*TestSuite.py* Contains the main tool, running modes are `Full`,`Space`,`Tune`,`Verification`,`History`,`Testing`,`Delete`. Options args are `trials`,`variance-runs`, and `dims`
-*TestSuiteGraphs.py* Contains a utility for generating graphs based on the logs generated by TestSuite
-*TestSuiteArgParser.py* Parses the command line and generates variables to be consumed by TestSuite
-*TestableKernel.py* Defines what a 'kernel' is to be passed to the TestSuite. At a high level it contains a reference to the tunable kernel, a reference to an input generator, parameter generator and numpy verification function.
-*TestParameters.py* Defines the parameters for a test run of the TestSuite. Includes number of trial runs, variance runs, and dims.
